SimNet is a web interface to visulaize protein sequence similarities in a netwrk diagram. The networks diagrams are created based on similarity searches performed using BLAST, FastA, HMMER, or SSearch. 

### Running the application
The application can be run through `index.py`.

### Sample database
`protein_network.sql` contains a sample database created for reviewed diatom proteins.
